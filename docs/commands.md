```yaml
default-permissions:
  join: true

## Commands

Every command has its own specified permission in brackets. 

`<argument>` is required argument.   
`[argument]` is optional argument, and the command can be executed if this argument is not specified. However, every optional argument before this optional argument must be specified in order to be able to use this argument.
