# PlaceholderAPI

This plugin registers placeholders to [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).

These placeholders are intended for use in other plugins and may not function if used in the BedWars configuration. However, they can be utilized in `shop.yml` and other shop-related files if PlaceholderAPI is installed. Use the slightly modified syntax: `%papi.<placeholder_name>%` (e.g., `%papi.bedwars_all_games_players%`).

## Statistics placeholders

### Player stats placeholders

!!! tip "Custom leaderboards"
    
    You can create custom leaderboards using placeholders to display player statistics in various ways. To achieve this, consider using the [ajLeaderboards](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ajleaderboards.85548/) plugin with the placeholders listed below. This allows for greater flexibility beyond what the BedWars plugin offers.

    Need help setting it up? See the [ajLeaderboards Setup Guide](https://wiki.ajg0702.us/ajLeaderboards/setup/) for detailed instructions.

    For example, after adding a new board for kills using:
    ```
    /ajlb add %bedwars_stats_kills%
    ```
    you can display the top playerâ€™s name and value using:
    ```
    %ajlb_lb_bedwars_stats_kills_1_alltime_name%
    %ajlb_lb_bedwars_stats_kills_1_alltime_value%
    ```

    If you want to use a leaderboard ordered by total score, you can use the [built-in placeholders](#score-leaderboard-placeholders) instead of ajLeaderboards.

The placeholders in this section are specific to a player, based on the context in which they are used, most commonly the viewer of a message, hologram, etc.

* `%bedwars_stats_deaths%` - Returns the number of deaths.
* `%bedwars_stats_destroyed_beds%` - Returns the number of destroyed beds.
* `%bedwars_stats_kills%` - Returns the number of kills.
* `%bedwars_stats_loses%` - Returns the number of losses.
* `%bedwars_stats_score%` - Returns the total score.
* `%bedwars_stats_wins%` - Returns the number of wins.
* `%bedwars_stats_games%` - Returns the total number of games played.
* `%bedwars_stats_kd%` - Returns the kill/death ratio.

### Any player stats placeholders

When using these placeholders, replace `<player>` with the specific player's name. For example, if the player's name is `Misat11`, you would use `%bedwars_otherstats_Misat11_deaths%`.

* `%bedwars_otherstats_<player>_deaths%` - Returns the number of deaths.
* `%bedwars_otherstats_<player>_destroyed_beds%` - Returns the number of destroyed beds.
