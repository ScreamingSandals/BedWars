Then, configure each option according to your requirements:</p> <ul> <li><code>serverRestart</code> - Determines whether the server should restart after the game ends. This is not mandatory for the plugin; adjust this setting as needed. To enable server restarts, an existing startup script (<code>.sh</code> or <code>.bat</code>) must be defined in <code>spigot.yml</code>.</li> <li><code>serverStop</code> - Similar to <code>serverRestart</code>, but only shuts down the server. Use this only if you have separate software managing automatic server startup.</li> <li><code>server</code> - Specifies the hub server to which players are moved after the game ends.</li> <li><code>auto-game-connect</code> - Determines whether users should automatically join the BedWars game upon server join. This should typically be enabled unless managed by an addon.</li> <li><code>kick-when-proxy-too-slow</code> - If the proxy fails to move the player to the hub server or is too slow, the server will kick players who are waiting for too long.</li> <li><code>random-game-selection</code> - Enables random selection of arenas if multiple arenas are on the same server. Set <code>enabled</code> to <code>true</code> to use this feature. The <code>preselect-games</code> option is useful for knowing the next selected game before any player joins (at server startup or after the previous game ends).</li> <li><code>motd</code> - Useful for server selection plugins utilizing MOTD text, such as BungeeSigns. If enabled, the plugin will update the MOTD based on the current state and player count. There are five states: <code>waiting</code>, <code>waiting_full</code>, <code>running</code>, <code>rebuilding</code>, and <code>disabled</code>. Use the placeholders <code>%name%</code> for arena name, <code>%current%</code> for current player count, and <code>%max%</code> for maximum player count. Messages can be colored using legacy color codes (<code>\u00a7&lt;color code&gt;</code>).</li> </ul> <p>The configuration section might look like this:</p> <pre><code>bungee:\n  enabled: false\n  serverRestart: true\n  serverStop: false\n  server: hub\n  auto-game-connect: false\n  kick-when-proxy-too-slow: true\n  random-game-selection:\n    enabled: true\n    preselect-games: false\n  motd:\n    enabled: false\n    waiting: '%name%: Waiting for players [%current%/%max%]'\n    waiting_full: '%name%: Game is full [%current%/%max%]'\n    running: '%name%: Game is running [%current%/%max%]'\n    rebuilding: '%name%: Rebuilding...'\n    disabled: '%name%: Game is disabled'\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"bungee/#configuring-hub-servers","title":"Configuring Hub Servers","text":"<p>While there is no lobby plugin for Screaming BedWars, any server selection plugin can be used, such as BungeeSigns. Plugins that can read MOTD are preferred as they can relay the game state to your hub server.</p> <p>If you prefer to use inventory-based GUIs instead of signs and wish to display information from the server's MOTD, you can utilize any inventory plugin compatible with PlaceholderAPI, such as DeluxeMenus. The Pinger expansion is recommended, as it provides the necessary placeholders for this purpose. To create a server selector using DeluxeMenus, you may refer to this guide and review this example.</p> <p>Synchronizing Statistics</p> <p>For BungeeCord networks, it is common to synchronize statistics to a database. Configure the <code>database</code> section as described here. Ensure all servers are connected to the same database.</p> <p>To access statistics in the lobby, the simplest option is to install Screaming BedWars on your hub server as well. Ensure this instance is NOT in BungeeCord mode. Alternatively, you can create an addon to retrieve statistics.

Under this section, you can configure the database connection. Currently only MySQL and MariaDB are officially supported, yet the configuration allows you to provide a custom driver for a newer version of the database system or a driver for a different SQL-like database system like PostgreSQL. Pull requests fixing support with different database systems are welcome :)</p> <p>To enable the database connection, you have to set something to be saved in database. Currently only statistics can be saved to the database. To enable that, locate the <code>statistics</code> section and switch <code>type</code> from <code>yaml</code> to <code>database</code>.</p> <p>There are following fields in the database section:</p> <ul> <li><code>host</code> is the hostname or IP address of the database server, defaults to <code>localhost</code>.</li> <li><code>port</code> is the port of the database server, defaults to <code>3306</code> which is the default port for MySQL/MariaDB.</li> <li><code>db</code> is the name of the database, defaults to <code>database</code></li> <li><code>user</code> is the user of the database system with access to database specified <code>db</code>. The user needs to be able to change the structure of the database. Defaults to <code>root</code>, though applications should not have root access.</li> <li><code>password</code> is the password of the database user. Defaults to <code>secret</code>, though you should choose better password (possibly generated).</li> <li><code>table-prefix</code> is a string which is prepended to table names, defaults to <code>bw_</code>.</li> <li><code>type</code> is type of the database system, defaults to <code>mysql</code> (valid for both MySQL and MariaDB when the MySQL driver is used).</li> <li><code>driver</code> is the driver, which is going to be used. There are two possible options:</li> <li>You can set it to <code>default</code>. The driver will be chosen based on the type. Both Spigot and Paper servers provide driver for type <code>mysql</code>. Other plugins may provide other drivers to the classpath.</li> <li>To use a third-party driver, specify the path, for example <code>mysql-connector-j-8.0.0.jar</code>. The path is always relative to the <code>plugins/BedWars</code> folder, so we recommend putting the jar to this folder. The driver needs to be JDBC 4-compatible. The driver is not available to other plugins, and does not affect them in any way.</li> <li><code>params</code> is a map containing specific options for the driver. You should check documentation of the chosen database system before modifying it. By default, following parameters are set:   <pre><code>params:\n  useSSL: false  # change this to true if your database server requires SSL or runs on a different machine and has SSL enabled\n  serverTimezone: Europe/Prague  # default value is based on your system\n  autoReconnect: true\n  cachePrepStmts: true\n  prepStmtCacheSize: 250\n  prepStmtCacheSqlLimit: 2048\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Driver version</p> <p>If you use an ancient Minecraft version like 1.8.8, but you have new version of MySQL/MariaDB, the driver bundled in Spigot 1.8.8 may be incompatible. Get a new version of MySQL Connector J here: select Platform Independent, download the archive and extract the mysql-connector-j-8.x.x.jar file from it (other files from the archive are not relevant).
