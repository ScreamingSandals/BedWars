Flexible BedWars plugin formerly coded as a replacement for BedwarsRel.

Supported versions: \[1.9.4 - 1.17.1\]. Recommended version: \[1.16.5/1.17.1\]

If you are using version 0.2.x, you are probably looking for this [branch](https://github.com/ScreamingSandals/BedWars/tree/0.2.16)

### Current multiplatform goal

We are working on rewriting our plugin to our new library ScreamingLib. This allows us to port our plugin to new platforms such as Minestom, Sponge, Forge or even Nukkit.

We are currently in the process of removing bukkit api references. You can see the progress on this badge.  
Lower number means we are closer to our goal.
